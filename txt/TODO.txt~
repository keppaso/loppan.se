1. Password should be set to empty if it fails vaildation  on both register and login
2. Decide on how to save recipes, most likely in database but the structure.
   it should be categorised... Maybe not a database but a json file?
   a json file containing all absolute urls to the receipes including rating, tags and so forth.
   and a seperate json file for each receipe, i like this idea....
